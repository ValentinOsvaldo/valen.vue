# Why I think Vue is better than React

I want to start this post by saying, this is only my personal opinion and I feel free to write after 3 years coding on React. You feel free to share your thoughts on my X account.

## Introduction

I started coding on React in 2022, and I have to say, it was a great experience. I was able to build some amazing things with React, but I also had some issues with it. I started to notice that React was not the best choice for me, and I started to look for other options. I found Vue, and I was blown away by it. I started to use it for my projects, and I was able to build some amazing things with it. I also started to use it for my personal projects, and I was able to build some amazing things with it.
